These are some of my learnings and exploration done during my first Co-op job as an Engineering Assistant and Energy Analyst.
This project is for organzing data collected from FACIO and SIEMENS thermometer and hygrometer. 
The code provides an automated and stream-lined process when dealing with over thousands timestamps and over twenty different data types.
It is capable of spotting collection error (missing timestamps) and outputting errors (output being NaN).
It is also capable of appending multiple dataframes in a selected folder by inputting the name and path of the folder.
The codes also provides visualization through plotly library which generates interactive graphs with simply python.
